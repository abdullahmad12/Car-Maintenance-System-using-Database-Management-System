The backend was created by using SQL Server as IDE and SQL as the programming language. For our frontend, we use C#. In which we created an interactive interface for the user. We connect our local host database with C# and Sql we are performing queries on the database.
We have main  Entities in which we are storing our Data. We can perform Addition, Deletion, Updating, Searching on these 6 Entities while the 7th Entity Usertable only store the username and password data of the admin required for the login.
